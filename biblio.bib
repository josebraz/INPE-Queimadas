	abstract = {A transformation defined on the near-infrared (NIR) and middle-infrared (MIR) space is presented that allows deriving a new coordinate system appropriate for vegetation and burned area discrimination. The transformation is based on the difference between MIR and NIR in conjunction with the distance from a convergence point in the MIR/NIR space, representative of a totally burnt surface. One of the derived coordinates presents a small scatter for pixels associated to vegetated surfaces (strict scale) whereas the other one covers a wide range of values (large scale) that suggest its use as a proxy of water content of vegetation. The strict scale character of the first coordinate together with the large scale character of the second one make the coordinate system especially adequate to discriminate vegetated surfaces and rank them according to the water content, from green and dry to burned vegetation. The performance of the new coordinate system is then assessed against than traditional ratio or modified ratio indices (namely the Vegetation Index, the Burned Area Index and the Global Environmental Monitoring Index, modified to the MIR/NIR space) and it is shown that the new coordinate system provides better information than traditional indices, opening interesting perspectives for burned area discrimination and other applications like drought monitoring.},

@article{SCHROEDER2008,
	abstract = {In this study we implemented a comprehensive analysis to validate the MODIS and GOES satellite active fire detection products (MOD14 and WFABBA, respectively) and characterize their major sources of omission and commission errors which have important implications for a large community of fire data users. Our analyses were primarily based on the use of 30 m resolution ASTER and ETM+ imagery as our validation data. We found that at the 50% true positive detection probability mark, WFABBA requires four times more active fire area than is necessary for MOD14 to achieve the same probability of detection, despite the 16× factor separating the nominal spatial resolutions of the two products. Approximately 75% and 95% of all fires sampled were omitted by the MOD14 and WFABBA instantaneous products, respectively; whereas an omission error of 38% was obtained for WFABBA when considering the 30-minute interval of the GOES data. Commission errors for MOD14 and WFABBA were found to be similar and highly dependent on the vegetation conditions of the areas imaged, with the larger commission errors (approximately 35%) estimated over regions of active deforestation. Nonetheless, the vast majority (>80%) of the commission errors were indeed associated with recent burning activity where scars could be visually confirmed in the higher resolution data. Differences in thermal dynamics of vegetated and non-vegetated areas were found to produce a reduction of approximately 50% in the commission errors estimated towards the hours of maximum fire activity (i.e., early-afternoon hours) which coincided with the MODIS/Aqua overpass. Lastly, we demonstrate the potential use of temporal metrics applied to the mid-infrared bands of MODIS and GOES data to reduce the commission errors found with the validation analyses.},

@article{GIGLIO2016,
	abstract = {The two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments, on-board NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites, have provided more than a decade of global fire data. Here we describe improvements made to the fire detection algorithm and swath-level product that were implemented as part of the Collection 6 land-product reprocessing, which commenced in May 2015. The updated algorithm is intended to address limitations observed with the previous Collection 5 fire product, notably the occurrence of false alarms caused by small forest clearings, and the omission of large fires obscured by thick smoke. Processing was also expanded to oceans and other large water bodies to facilitate monitoring of offshore gas flaring. Additionally, fire radiative power (FRP) is now retrieved using a radiance-based approach, generally decreasing FRP for all but the comparatively small fraction of high intensity fire pixels. We performed a Stage-3 validation of the Collection 5 and Collection 6 Terra MODIS fire products using reference fire maps derived from more than 2500 high-resolution Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images. Our results indicated targeted improvements in the performance of the Collection 6 active fire detection algorithm compared to Collection 5, with reduced omission errors over large fires, and reduced false alarm rates in tropical ecosystems. Overall, the MOD14 Collection 6 daytime global commission error was 1.2%, compared to 2.4% in Collection 5. Regionally, the probability of detection for Collection 6 exhibited a ~3% absolute increase in Boreal North America and Boreal Asia compared to Collection 5, a ~1% absolute increase in Equatorial Asia and Central Asia, a ~1% absolute decrease in South America above the Equator, and little or no change in the remaining regions considered. Not unexpectedly, the observed variability in the probability of detection was strongly driven by regional differences in fire size. Overall, there was a net improvement in Collection 6 algorithm performance globally.},

	abstract = {The two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on-board NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites have provided nearly two decades of global fire data. Here, we describe refinements made to the 500-m global burned area mapping algorithm that were implemented in late 2016 as part of the MODIS Collection 6 (C6) land-product reprocessing. The updated algorithm improves upon the heritage Collection 5.1 (C5.1) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 algorithms by offering significantly better detection of small burns, a modest reduction in burn-date temporal uncertainty, and a large reduction in the extent of unmapped areas. Comparison of the C6 and C5.1 MCD64A1 products for fifteen years (2002--2016) on a regional basis shows that the C6 product detects considerably more burned area globally (26%) and in almost every region considered. The sole exception was in Boreal North America, where the mean annual area burned was 6% lower for C6, primarily as a result of a large increase in the number of small lakes mapped (and subsequently masked) at high latitudes in the upstream C6 input data. With respect to temporal reporting accuracy, 44% of the C6 MCD64A1 burned grid cells were detected on the same day as an active fire, and 68% within 2 days, which represents a substantial reduction in temporal uncertainty compared to the C5.1 MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 products. In addition, an areal accuracy assessment of the C6 burned area product undertaken using high resolution burned area reference maps derived from 108 Landsat image pairs is reported.},
