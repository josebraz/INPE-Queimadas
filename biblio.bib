	abstract = {MODIS fire hotspots have been widely used to study fire occurrence at a global scale as they provide highly relevant information on fire events, on their spatial and seasonal trends. Nevertheless, they present some difficulties to estimate the actual magnitude of fire activity, as the relations between active fires and burned areas are not constant in space and time. Some previous studies have demonstrated that the total burned area can be estimated from the number of hotspots using regional models, but relations were established with coarse resolution data. We present in this paper a more detailed study on the relations between MODIS hotspots and burned areas, as extracted from Landsat images, which are commonly considered as reference data for validation of global burned area products. The comparison has been conducted in nine study regions with significant fire activity and in a sample of sites with low fire occurrence. Our results show that MODIS hotspots are very reliable to detect true burned areas, with only 1.8% of them not associated to actual burned patches, except for urban areas where very high commission errors were observed. On the contrary, the number of burned patches not detected by MODIS hotspots was found relatively high considering all fires (36--86%), decreasing for burn patches with a larger size (0--20% for burned patches larger than 500ha) and for areas with a lower grassland and shrubland cover. A linear relationship between the number of hotspots and the total burned area was observed within each study area. However, the slope of the regression varied strongly between study sites. It was observed that sites with a larger proportion of grass and shrub cover had a larger mean burned area associated to each hotspot. The results presented in this study improve the understanding of the spatial variability and characteristics of the hotspots and should help to use the hotspots in future research.},

@article{LIBONATI2010,
	abstract = {The ephemeral character of the radiative signal together with the presence of aerosols imposes severe limitations on the use of classical approaches, e.g. based on red and near-infrared, to discriminate between burned and unburned surfaces in tropical environments. Surface reflectance in the middle-infrared (MIR) has been used to circumvent these difficulties because the signal is virtually unaffected by the presence of aerosols associated to biomass burning. Retrieval of the MIR reflected component from the total signal is, however, a difficult problem because of the presence of a diversity of radiance sources, namely the surface reflected solar irradiance and the surface emitted radiance that may reach comparable magnitude during daytime. The method proposed by Kaufman and Remer (1994) to retrieve surface MIR reflectance presents the advantage of not requiring auxiliary datasets (e.g. atmospheric profiles) nor major computational means (e.g. for solving radiative transfer models). Nevertheless, the method was specifically designed to retrieve MIR reflectance over dense dark forests in the middle latitudes and, as shown in the present study, severe problems may arise when applying it beyond the range of validity, namely for burned area mapping in tropical environments. The present study consists of an assessment of the performance of the method for a wide range of atmospheric, geometric and surface conditions and of the usefulness of extracted surface reflectances for burned area discrimination. Results show that, in the case of tropical environments, there is a significant decrease in performance of the method for high values of land surface temperature, especially when associated with low sun elevation angles. Burned area discrimination is virtually impaired in such conditions, which are often present when using data from instruments on-board polar orbiters, namely MODIS in Aqua and Terra, to map burned surfaces over the Amazon forest and ``cerrado'' savanna regions.},

@article{Lizundia2020,
	abstract = {This paper presents the generation of a global burned area mapping algorithm using MODIS hotspots and near-infrared reflectance within ESA's Fire_cci project. The algorithm is based on a hybrid approach that combines MODIS highest resolution (250 m) near-infrared band and active fire information from thermal channels. The burned area is detected in two phases. In the first step, pixels with a high probability of being burned are selected in order to reduce commission errors. To do that, spatio-temporal active-fire clusters are created to determine adaptive thresholds. Finally, a contextual growing approach is applied from those pixels to the neighbouring area to fully detect the burned patch and reduce omission errors. The algorithm was used to obtain a time series of global burned area dataset (named FireCCI51), covering the 2001--2018 period. Validation based on 1200 sampled sites covering the period from 2003 to 2014 showed an average omission and commission errors of 67.1% and 54.4%. When using longer validation periods, the errors were found smaller (54.5% omission and 25.7% commission for the additional 1000 African sampled sites), which indicates that the product is negatively influenced by temporal reporting accuracy. The inter-comparison carried out with previous Fire_cci versions (FireCCI41 and FireCCI50), and NASA's standard burned area product (MCD64A1 c6) showed consistent spatial and temporal patterns. However, the new algorithm estimated an average BA of 4.63 Mkm2, with a maximum of 5.19 Mkm2 (2004) and a minimum of 3.94 Mkm2 (in 2001), increasing current burned area estimations. Besides, the new product was found more sensitive to detect smaller burned patches. This new product, called FireCCI51, is publicly available at: http://cci.esa.int/data, last accessed on September 2019.},

	abstract = {Fire has a diverse range of impacts on Earth's physical and social systems. Accurate and up to date information on areas affected by fire is critical to better understand drivers of fire activity, as well as its relevance for biogeochemical cycles, climate, air quality, and to aid fire management. Mapping burned areas was traditionally done from field sketches. With the launch of the first Earth observation satellites, remote sensing quickly became a more practical alternative to detect burned areas, as they provide timely regional and global coverage of fire occurrence. This review paper explores the physical basis to detect burned area from satellite observations, describes the historical trends of using satellite sensors to monitor burned areas, summarizes the most recent approaches to map burned areas and evaluates the existing burned area products (both at global and regional scales). Finally, it identifies potential future opportunities to further improve burned area detection from Earth observation satellites.},

	abstract = {A transformation defined on the near-infrared (NIR) and middle-infrared (MIR) space is presented that allows deriving a new coordinate system appropriate for vegetation and burned area discrimination. The transformation is based on the difference between MIR and NIR in conjunction with the distance from a convergence point in the MIR/NIR space, representative of a totally burnt surface. One of the derived coordinates presents a small scatter for pixels associated to vegetated surfaces (strict scale) whereas the other one covers a wide range of values (large scale) that suggest its use as a proxy of water content of vegetation. The strict scale character of the first coordinate together with the large scale character of the second one make the coordinate system especially adequate to discriminate vegetated surfaces and rank them according to the water content, from green and dry to burned vegetation. The performance of the new coordinate system is then assessed against than traditional ratio or modified ratio indices (namely the Vegetation Index, the Burned Area Index and the Global Environmental Monitoring Index, modified to the MIR/NIR space) and it is shown that the new coordinate system provides better information than traditional indices, opening interesting perspectives for burned area discrimination and other applications like drought monitoring.},

@article{SCHROEDER2008,
	abstract = {In this study we implemented a comprehensive analysis to validate the MODIS and GOES satellite active fire detection products (MOD14 and WFABBA, respectively) and characterize their major sources of omission and commission errors which have important implications for a large community of fire data users. Our analyses were primarily based on the use of 30 m resolution ASTER and ETM+ imagery as our validation data. We found that at the 50% true positive detection probability mark, WFABBA requires four times more active fire area than is necessary for MOD14 to achieve the same probability of detection, despite the 16× factor separating the nominal spatial resolutions of the two products. Approximately 75% and 95% of all fires sampled were omitted by the MOD14 and WFABBA instantaneous products, respectively; whereas an omission error of 38% was obtained for WFABBA when considering the 30-minute interval of the GOES data. Commission errors for MOD14 and WFABBA were found to be similar and highly dependent on the vegetation conditions of the areas imaged, with the larger commission errors (approximately 35%) estimated over regions of active deforestation. Nonetheless, the vast majority (>80%) of the commission errors were indeed associated with recent burning activity where scars could be visually confirmed in the higher resolution data. Differences in thermal dynamics of vegetated and non-vegetated areas were found to produce a reduction of approximately 50% in the commission errors estimated towards the hours of maximum fire activity (i.e., early-afternoon hours) which coincided with the MODIS/Aqua overpass. Lastly, we demonstrate the potential use of temporal metrics applied to the mid-infrared bands of MODIS and GOES data to reduce the commission errors found with the validation analyses.},

	abstract = {The two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments, on-board NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites, have provided more than a decade of global fire data. Here we describe improvements made to the fire detection algorithm and swath-level product that were implemented as part of the Collection 6 land-product reprocessing, which commenced in May 2015. The updated algorithm is intended to address limitations observed with the previous Collection 5 fire product, notably the occurrence of false alarms caused by small forest clearings, and the omission of large fires obscured by thick smoke. Processing was also expanded to oceans and other large water bodies to facilitate monitoring of offshore gas flaring. Additionally, fire radiative power (FRP) is now retrieved using a radiance-based approach, generally decreasing FRP for all but the comparatively small fraction of high intensity fire pixels. We performed a Stage-3 validation of the Collection 5 and Collection 6 Terra MODIS fire products using reference fire maps derived from more than 2500 high-resolution Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) images. Our results indicated targeted improvements in the performance of the Collection 6 active fire detection algorithm compared to Collection 5, with reduced omission errors over large fires, and reduced false alarm rates in tropical ecosystems. Overall, the MOD14 Collection 6 daytime global commission error was 1.2%, compared to 2.4% in Collection 5. Regionally, the probability of detection for Collection 6 exhibited a ~3% absolute increase in Boreal North America and Boreal Asia compared to Collection 5, a ~1% absolute increase in Equatorial Asia and Central Asia, a ~1% absolute decrease in South America above the Equator, and little or no change in the remaining regions considered. Not unexpectedly, the observed variability in the probability of detection was strongly driven by regional differences in fire size. Overall, there was a net improvement in Collection 6 algorithm performance globally.},

@article{GIGLIO201872,
	abstract = {The two Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments on-board NASA's Terra and Aqua satellites have provided nearly two decades of global fire data. Here, we describe refinements made to the 500-m global burned area mapping algorithm that were implemented in late 2016 as part of the MODIS Collection 6 (C6) land-product reprocessing. The updated algorithm improves upon the heritage Collection 5.1 (C5.1) MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 algorithms by offering significantly better detection of small burns, a modest reduction in burn-date temporal uncertainty, and a large reduction in the extent of unmapped areas. Comparison of the C6 and C5.1 MCD64A1 products for fifteen years (2002--2016) on a regional basis shows that the C6 product detects considerably more burned area globally (26%) and in almost every region considered. The sole exception was in Boreal North America, where the mean annual area burned was 6% lower for C6, primarily as a result of a large increase in the number of small lakes mapped (and subsequently masked) at high latitudes in the upstream C6 input data. With respect to temporal reporting accuracy, 44% of the C6 MCD64A1 burned grid cells were detected on the same day as an active fire, and 68% within 2 days, which represents a substantial reduction in temporal uncertainty compared to the C5.1 MCD64A1 and MCD45A1 products. In addition, an areal accuracy assessment of the C6 burned area product undertaken using high resolution burned area reference maps derived from 108 Landsat image pairs is reported.},
